# Route Script for Bots-engine #

A special routescript called botsengine.py can be added. This is called by the bots-engine at various points. You may wish to use this for your own logging, reporting or cleanup routines.

In Bots v3.2+ There are **pre** and **post** exit points for all runs, and for each type of run (command).

  * pre (before any run)
  * prenew
  * preresend
  * prerereceive
  * preautomaticretrycommunicationcommunication
  * precleanup
  * postnew
  * postresend
  * postrereceive
  * postautomaticretrycommunicationcommunication
  * postcleanup
  * post (after any run)



```
# user script example for some bots-engine exit points,
# showing the passed args.

# before any run
def pre(commandstorun,routestorun):
    print 'pre',commandstorun,routestorun

# before "new" run
def prenew(routestorun):
    print 'prenew',routestorun

# after "cleanup" run
def postcleanup(routestorun):
    print 'postcleanup',routestorun

# after any run
def post(commandstorun,routestorun):
    print 'post',commandstorun,routestorun

```

### Example of doing something useful with exit points ###

The **postcleanup** exit point can be used to add your own daily tasks (eg. cleanup, backup or reporting capabilities). By default, bots runs a cleanup **once per day** at the end of the first run that day. (setting whencleanup=daily in bots.ini)

This example automatically activates or deactivates partners on the dates you configure for the partner (startdate, enddate)

```
import bots.botslib as botslib
import datetime

def postcleanup(routestorun):

        # activate any partners with a "start date" of today
        botslib.changeq(u'''UPDATE partner
                            SET active = 1
                            WHERE startdate = %(today)s''',
                            {'today':datetime.datetime.today().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')})

        # deactivate any active partners with an "end date" before today
        botslib.changeq(u'''UPDATE partner
                            SET active = 0
                            WHERE active = 1
                            AND  enddate is not null
                            AND enddate < %(today)s''',
                            {'today':datetime.datetime.today().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')})

```
