<h2>It's hard to get started</h2>
Often people experience a steep learning curve when starting with edi.<br>
One reason is that of lot of knowledge is involved:<br>
<ul><li>edi standards (edifact, x12, tradacoms, EANCOM etc)<br>
</li><li>business processes between you and your edi-partner (logistics!), changes in the business processes<br>
</li><li>understand what your edi-partner wants/requires<br>
</li><li>edi communication methods (x400, VAN's, AS2 etc)<br>
</li><li>imports and exports of your ERP system<br>
</li><li>specifics of the edi software.<br>
</li><li>etc</li></ul>

<br>
It is hard to find good information about edi: standards are not always free (eg x12 is not free), decent example messages are hard to get and often if is hard to find good information on Internet.<br>
Edi is traditionally 'closed' and sparse with information.<br>
Partly this seems to be a 'cultural thing', partly because edi existed before Internet, partly because it is all about business data that is not for the general public.<br>
<br>
<br>
Don't give up! ;-))<br>
I think everybody who started with edi has gone through this.<br>
