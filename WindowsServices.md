# Creating Windows Services #

If running Bots on a Windows server, you can create services to keep the important background processes running. This is the equivalent of a "daemon" process in Linux.

### Prerequisites ###
  * **srvany.exe** - This is a Microsoft utility included in the Windows Server [Resource Kit Tools](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=17657).
  * **sc.exe** - The SC command is included by default in most Windows installations and is also available in the resource kit.
  * Python and Bots are already installed and working, of course!

### Procedure ###
  * Copy srvany.exe to C:\Windows\System32

  * Open a command prompt and enter the following commands, according to the service required. Note: position of equal signs and spaces must be exactly as shown.
```
sc create "Bots Webserver" binPath= "C:\Windows\System32\srvany.exe" start= auto DisplayName= "Bots Webserver"
sc description "Bots Webserver" "This is the webserver for Bots EDI translator."
```
```
sc create "Bots Job Queue" binPath= "C:\Windows\System32\srvany.exe" start= auto DisplayName= "Bots Job Queue"
sc description "Bots Job Queue" "Provides job queue and launch functionality for Bots EDI Translator"
```
```
sc create "Bots Directory Monitor" binPath= "C:\Windows\System32\srvany.exe" start= auto DisplayName= "Bots Directory Monitor"
sc description "Bots Directory Monitor" "Monitors one or more directories for new files and creates Bots jobs to process them"
```

  * Run regedit and navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\<Service Name>`

  * In the right hand pane of regedit, right click, New, Key, call it `Parameters`.

  * Click the new Parameters key to select it.

  * In the right hand pane, right click, New, String value, call it `Application`.

  * Double click Application, enter the command to run the required Bots script. This will vary according to your installed location and Bots version, eg.
```
C:\Python27\python.exe C:\Python27\Scripts\bots-webserver.py
C:\Python27\python.exe C:\Python27\Scripts\bots-jobqueueserver.py
C:\Python27\python.exe C:\Python27\Scripts\bots-dirmonitor.py
```

  * Run `services.msc` to start/stop/configure your new services.

If any of the above doesn't make sense to you, I have created a small free utility program to do it all. This is a general purpose program for creating services. My service configuration for Bots is included; you may need to edit the paths to suit your installation. You can download the program from <a href='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43043107/CreateWinSrv.zip'>here</a>.<br>
