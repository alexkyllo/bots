## Installation FAQ ##
  * I try to install bots at Windows Vista/7, but.....
    * Probably a rights problem - you'll have to have administrator rights in order to do a proper install.
    * Right click the installer program, and choose 'Run as Administrator'.
    * Bots works on Vista/7/8!
    * sometimes the shortcut is not installed in the menu, and you will have to make this manually. See [StartGetBotsRunning](StartGetBotsRunning.md)
  * Does bots have edifact and x12 messages installed out-of-the-box?
    * No. But this can be downloaded on the [sourceforge site](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bots/files) either as part of a working configuration (plugin) of separate (grammars).
  * Bots is not working on linux - rights problems.
    * Start bots-webserver and bots-engine with sufficient rights - e.g. as root.
    * Change the owner/rights of the files in botssys, usersys and config; run bots-webserver/bots-engine without root rights.
  * During windows installation: Error:
```
close failed in file object destructor: 
sys.excepthook is missing 
lost sys.stderr
```
    * seems to happen when UAC is turned off.
    * Actually bots just seems to be installed OK, and works OK.....
    * Fixed this in version 3.2
