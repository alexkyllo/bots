## Changes in database format since version 3.0.0rc ##
Alas: the database as used in the 3.0.0rc version has changed!
Changed is:
  * table channel: field 'testpath' is added
  * table report: field 'acceptance' is added
  * tabel ccode: field 'rightcode'->70pos
  * tabel ccode: field 'attr1'->70pos
