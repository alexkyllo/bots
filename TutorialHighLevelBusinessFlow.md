# High Level EDI Business Flow #

Various documents need to be exchanged during the lifecycle of a business transaction.  A generic flow is shown below, this focuses on the business processes, not a particular EDI implementation (we'll get to that later).

There may be other communication, for example business process/contracts may dictate that all changes are requested and approved by email prior to the ERP systems being modified.

# Example Business Flow #
  * Buyer (customer) creates a purchase order (PO)
  * PO is sent to supplier via EDI
  * Supplier loads a Sale Order in response to the PO, with optional changes.
  * Supplier acknowledges PO (with any changes)
  * Buyer changes quantity of a line (part)
  * Buyer-initiated Change Request is sent to supplier via EDI
  * Supplier implements or rejects changes
  * Supplier sends summary of changes/rejects to buyer via EDI
  * Supplier needs to delete a line as they can no longer supply
  * Supplier sends supplier-initiated change request to buyer/customer via EDI
  * Buyer receives change request and implement or rejects changes
  * Supplier ships material
  * Supplier sends an [Advance Ship Notice](TutorialAdvanceShipNotice.md) (shipping manifest) via EDI
  * Supplier sends invoice via EDI
