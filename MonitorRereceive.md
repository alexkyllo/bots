## How to re-receive ##
Incoming files can be 're-received'.<br>
When re-receiving the (previously received) file is taken from the archive, and re-processed.<br>
As the file from the archive is used, no (outside) communication is used.<br>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol><li>in the incoming screen, go to the start (in front of each line); a small menu will pop-up. Choose 'rereceive' from this menu. The file will be marked as 'rereveive'. Mark all files that you want to re-receive.<br>
</li><li>Go to main menu->Run->Run user-indicated re-receives<br>
</li><li>The engine will now start, and do all the re-receives you marked.</li></ol>

<br>
<h3>Re-receive many files</h3>
As the files need to be marked one by one, this can be troublesome when you need to re-receive many files.<br>
In the screen for incoming there is a button called 'Rereceive all'. When you use this button all files in the selection are marked as re-receive. This might take some while.<br>
Warning: <b>all</b> files in the selection are marked, not only the ones visible on your page.<br>
Tip: first make the right selection via the button 'Change Selection'. Additional individual files can be marked/de-marked later.<br>
