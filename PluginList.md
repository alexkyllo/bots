  * my\_first\_plugin
    * This plugin is used in the the [tutorial](StartMyFirstPlugin.md).
    * edifact ORDERS to fixed records.
  * edifact2xml\_ordersdesadvinvoice
    * The most used edifact messages in one package.
    * edifact ORDERS to xml
    * ASN/shipping list: edifact2xml\_ordersdesadvinvoice to edifact DESADV.
    * Invoice: xml to to edifact INVOIC.
  * x12toxml\_supplier\_version\_850-856-810-997
    * The most used x12 messages in one package.
    * translate x12 850 -> xml orders.
    * Generates 997's for the received orders.
    * translate xml ASN's -> x12 856; including partner specific translation to 856.
    * translate xml invoices -> x12 810.
  * x12toxml\_retailer\_version\_850-856-810-997
    * The most used x12 messages in one package.
    * translate xml orders -> x12 850.
    * translate x12 856 -> xml ASN's
    * translate x12 810 -> xml invoices
  * x12toxml\_one-on-one\_835-837
    * translate x12 835 > xml and reverse (xml->x12 835)
    * translate x12 837 > xml and reverse (xml->x12 837)
    * one-on-one mapping: structure of xml is similar to structure of x12
    * x12 envelopes are included in mapping
  * demo\_composite\_route
    * demonstrates the use of composite routes.
    * 2 different sources are used for incoming edifact files
    * convert edifact orders to fixed format.
    * also converts these orders to print format (html).
    * convert edifact SLSRPT to csv format.
    * all outgoing messages go to different destination using filtered outchannels
  * edifact2fixed\_orders-desadv-invoic
    * The most used edifact messages in one package.
    * Suited for Dutch non-food retailers; probably for a lot of other retailers as well.
    * edifact ORDERS to fixed file format.
    * generate a edifact APERAK message (if requested in the order).
    * fixed format ASN/shipping list to a edifact DESADV.
    * fixed format invoice to edifact INVOIC.
  * demo\_working\_with\_partners demonstrates the use of partner dependent functionalities in bots:
    * parter dependent translations.
    * user of 'default translation'  and imports.
    * partner dependent syntax.
    * use of partner-lookup in the database.
    * use of partner groups.
    * different destinations/outchannels for partners.
    * advanced usage of ISA qualifiers/partnerID. Your partnerID is used to lookup the ediID and ISA qualifier in database (and of course vice versa).
  * demo\_sap\_idoc\_orders\_WPPLU
    * edifact D96A ORDERS to idoc ORDERS01.
    * edifact D96A PRICAT to idoc WP\_PLU02.
    * idoc ORDERS01 to edifact D96A ORDERS.
    * idoc WP\_PLU02 to edifact D96A PRICAT.
  * demo\_communicationscript
    * Demonstrates user communication scripting.
    * Incoming edi-messages can be passed one by one or as one batch.
  * demo\_databasecommunication
    * Demonstrates database communication scripts; both reading and writing (in separate routes).
    * A test database comes with the plugin.
  * demo\_mdn\_confirmations
    * Demo configuration for MDN (email confirmations)
    * See also documentation about confirmations.
  * demo\_one-on-one\_edifactorder2xml
    * Translates a edifact ORDERS D96A message to xml-message using edifact tags as xml-elements and vice versa.
    * For those who like processing xml instead of edifact.
    * It is quite easy to add other edifact messages types for similar translations.
  * edifact2json\_invoic
    * Translates edifact D96A invoice to JSON en vice versa.
  * edifact\_ordertoprint
    * Translates a edifact ORDERS D96A message into a readable format (HTML).
    * Of course you can print the order, so it is like a (edi)fax.
  * edifact\_orders2csv\_and\_vv
    * Translates edifact D96A orders to csv en vice versa.
    * There a 2 variants: csv with or without record tags (csv from eg excel is often without records tags).
  * edifact\_pricat-slsrpt
    * Csv to edifact PRICAT.
    * Edifact SLSRPT to csv.
  * demo\_preprocessing
    * This plugin demonstrate preprocessin: the incoming edifact-files start with an number of '#' and '@'. These characters are removed by preprocessing the files.


## Documentation on the contributed plugins on the bots web site ##
  * alto\_seperate\_headers\_details
    * input: 2 csv files, one with headers, one with details lines.
    * this is processed into one idoc (so the headers and details are merged).
    * Same technique is also usable for fixed format.
  * x12\_837\_4010\_to\_x12\_837\_5010
    * converts (physician) insurance claims (x12 837) in the version 4010 to the new, upcoming, 5010 version.          The mapping file is rudimentary, but I believe the conversion is OK.          I found that removing the one REF file creates a version 5010 file that is accepted and processed properly by Anvicare, the clearing house for my commercial claims.          I have included anonymized input edi transactions for Medicare, Blue Shield and commercial insurers.          My approach is to try the translation as is, and to make corrections in the mapping file only if I get errors from the clearing house.          Medicare and Blue Shield provide comprehensive error checking function.  However, they do not yet accept 5010 transactions, even for testing purposes.          The clearing house accepts 5010 transactions, and they work.<br>          Mind: setting the parties in the GS envelopes works for bots up from 1.6.3<br>
