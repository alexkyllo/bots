# Details about plugins #

  * A plugin is just a zip-file, you can view the contents.
  * A plugin has to contain a file (at the root) called _botsindex_. This contains the database configuration.
  * The plugins on the web-site contain example edi files so you can run a translation and see the results.
  * The edi files are in _bots/botssys/infile_; the results will be in _bots/botssys/outfile_.
  * When reading a plugin your existing current configuration is backupped (in _bots/botssys_)
  * When reading a plugin already existing database-entries, mapping scripts, grammars etc are overwritten.
  * In the web server log is logged what is installed (logging is in _bots/botssys/logging_).
  * There is no un-install.
  * Beware if you make a plugin and share this: do not use e.g. password for an email account.
  * Plugins contain source code. This is a potentially security risk. Use only plugins from trusted sources.
  * Grammars for edifact and x12 are NOT plugins, and can not be installed!
