## Recipe to push test->production (bots>=3.0) ##
Recipe to use a standard [directory comparison tool](UsefulTools#Compare_and_merge.md) to manage the differences in configuration between test and production:
  1. For both environments, make configuration index file (menu->Systasks->Make configuration index)
  1. Compare both environments using a [directory comparison tool](UsefulTools#Compare_and_merge.md). What you should compare is:
    * All files in _bots/usersys_.
    * Note that the file _bots/usersys/index.py_ contains the configuration as in the database (routes, channels, partners).
  1. Push changes using such this tool.
  1. And read configuration index file (menu->Systasks->Read configuration index) to the database.

<h2>Details</h2>
<ol><li>if the configuration index file is generated all configuration is in usersys (routes, mappings, partners etc).<br>
</li><li>By using the 'isolated acceptance test' both environments can be 'very equal'.<br>
</li><li>The configuration index file can also be generated by command line tool. 20130117: not read by command line tool.<br>
</li><li>Look like it is possible to use a version control system. I have not tried it, but recipes and experiences are welcome!
