## How do I make an edi configuration? ##

  1. Use [plugins](PluginIntroduction.md). This is a quick and easy way to install predefined configurations of bots.
    * Downloads: [bots sourceforge site](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bots/files/plugins/)
    * Description of plugins: [on this wiki page](PluginList.md)
    * Plugins can be shared by users and communities. Send your plugin!
  1. Use a plugin 'close' to what you want, and adapt.
  1. Do your own configuration:
    * Take a look at [the tutorial](StartMyFirstPlugin.md).
    * Use bots-monitor for configuration of routes, channels, translations and partners.
    * There are grammars for all edifact and x12 messages [on the bots sourceforge site](http://sourceforge.net/projects/bots/files/grammars/).
    * Grammars and mapping require knowledge of edi and edi-standards and some python knowledge. (python is a relatively easy programming, no deep knowledge of python is needed).
    * Use command line tool 'bots-xml2botsgrammar.py' to generate a grammar from an xml file.
    * Check a grammar using the command line tool 'bots-grammar.py'.
