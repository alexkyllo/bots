# Where did the name "Bots" come from? #

EDI is about cooperation in the supply chain (collaboration, tying together, etc). That is true, but on the other hand it is also a clash of cultures. In Dutch 'bots' is like 'crash'

'bots'  is also the nickname my grandfather-in-law used for my girlfriend.
it was not clear where that name came from, probably that was how she pronouced her name (betsy) when she learned to talk.

In Dutch 'bots' is singular.

but...its just a name.

kind regards,
